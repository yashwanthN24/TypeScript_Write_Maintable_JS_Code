# TypeScript_Write_Maintable_JS_Code

- Typescript is Javascript with syntax for types
- Typescript is a superset of js that helps write better and maintainable JS code
- Typescript is all about typesafety
- Typescript is a programming languaga built on top of javascript .
- It enhances javascript by offering serveral features that aid in creating more robust and maintable application while reducing development time
- The most significant feature typescript provides is "static typing"

- Typescript is Javascript with type checking ,It requires developers to explicitly specify variable types
- similiar to statically typed languages The typescript compiler code checks you code for type related errors at compile time itself
- catching many issues before runtime
- Even this helps you to identify and resolve error early in the development process
- You can use typescript in lot of domain from frontend to backend

- Why should we lean typescript?

- High Industry demand
- Simplification over JS code
- Efficiency
- Error prevention and Quick feedback (TypeScript detects errors before runtime providing instant feedback for faster and more reliable development
- Framework empowerment

- This is called as transpolation

- Setup
- Download vscode , nodejs (LTS) , verify node successfully installed by checking version node --version
- use node package manager to install typescript globally
- npm i -g typescript
- or
- npm install -g typescript
- after installation verify typescript by running tsc -v ( it should display the typescript version if its succesfully installed )
